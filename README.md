I'm currently learning how to use Github
- 🚀 I am starting several projects and will use this space for development and collaboration
- 🔍 I'm looking for tips on how to use Github to help me work effectively in Python and bring my ideas to life
### If you happen to stumble on this page, please check back in early 2025, when I hope to be well underway
